Node Module Scaffold
==========================

A grunt-init scaffold for reusable Node Modules.

This scaffolds configures a bare-bones module with a single function, as well as basic unit test for said function.

It also provides maintainability analytics out of the box with Plato, code coverage reports with Istanbul,
and automated documentation with JSDocs.

To utilize these tools and analytics, after deploying your development environment, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:9001/`

The scaffold provides the following grunt methods:

`grunt` - deploys the development environment with live reload.  This environment runs testing, doc gen, and analytics!

`grunt dist` - performs a build, bumps the version (hotfix), and pushes to your repo!


To use it, clone the project to your `~/.grunt-init` folder and follow the instructions here:  http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding


Once you have scaffolded a project, be sure to run `npm install` to set up the boiler plate dependencies!

Enjoy!
